## Pizza Sales Analysis

 [ Analyzing Pizza_Sales.sql ]

## Project Description

This project dives into pizza sales data, leveraging advanced SQL techniques to uncover key insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends. Queries cover a range of complexity — from basic aggregation to advanced analytical functions — to derive actionable insights
I utilized SQL to explore the data and answer key business questions to derive actionable insights.

## Tasks Performed

- Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the Pizza Sales dataset

- Analyzed order trends to identify peak sales hours and customer purchasing patterns.

- Computed total revenue and quantified pizza sales across different categories to evaluate performance

- Compared pizza sizes and types to determine the most popular choices among customers.

- Ranked pizzas by revenue contribution to uncover top-performing products.

- Generated cumulative revenue trends over time to track sales growth and performance.

- Summarized category-wise sales distribution to provide insights into customer preferences.

- Used SQL techniques like JOINs, WINDOW functions, CTEs, GROUP BY statements and aggregate functions for in-depth analysis 

- Presented findings in a structured format, delivering actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

 [Sales_Trends_at_Walmart.csv]( Sales_Trends_at_Walmart.sql) 


## Project Description

This project involved performing extensive analysis on a database of Walmart sales data to uncover insights into branch performance, product sales trends, and customer behavior. The dataset contained transaction details like product lines, payment methods, customer types, and ratings across multiple branches.

I utilized SQL to explore the data and derive insights that can help optimize sales strategies and improve customer targeting.

## Tasks Performed

- Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the dataset to ensure data consistency.

- Engineered new features such as time of day, day of the week, and month to identify sales patterns.

- Analyzed product line performance, identifying top sellers and product lines needing improvement

- Calculated total revenue per month and compared VAT (Value Added Tax) across cities

- Identified peak sales periods and the busiest days across different branches.

- Examined customer segments, gender distribution, and revenue contribution by customer type.

- Compared product line performance against average sales to classify them as Good or Bad

- Ranked branches by sales performance and uncovered factors affecting sales.

- Used SQL techniques like JOINs, CTEs, Window Functions, and CASE Statements for advanced analysis

- Presented findings in a clear format to support business decisions and strategy formulation.

Overall, this project enabled me to showcase my SQL skills to derive data-driven insights from Walmart sales data to support key business decisions and strategy.
